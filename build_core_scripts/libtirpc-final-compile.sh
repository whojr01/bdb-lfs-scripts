# The time data collected by this script is high-level in nature
# and does not record detailed information on the various steps
# of each build. 
#
# This limits the usefulness of the system down to just a general
# indicator of how much time a complete build will take on your
# system.
#
# Further the script utilizes the builtin time function in order
# to record how long it takes to execute the build so there is a
# fair margin of error in the actual reporting of the time. This
# timing function is just mearly to give an approximation of how
# long something takes and for that it's good enough and belongs
# in the Good Enough Inc company. ;-)
#
# Variables:
# BUILD - Contains the name of the build.
# STAGE - Contains which stage (Chapter 5/6)
# PASS  - Should be set to 1 or 2. (e.g bunutils, gcc.. etc)
# SCRIPT - Records the name of the build script.
# TIMETMPFILE - Used in the generation of time data. No need to change.
